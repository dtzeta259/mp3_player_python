# MP3 Player in Python

This is an MP3 Player Desktop Application created using Python and Tkinter. The application will read in
the directory the user selects to store mp3 files and will read in the existing mp3 files and display them
as a list. Currently, the app can list the songs that exist in the directory, browse the computer for other
directories with mp3 files, play the mp3 files, and pause the playing mp3 file.

This application is a work-in-progress and is not complete, but will do the basic functions for
an mp3 player. Additional functionalities are still being planned out and implemented.
